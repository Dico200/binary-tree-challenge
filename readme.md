# Binary Tree Challenge

The reconstruct_binary_tree.cpp file contains 2 challenges involving binary trees.  
Its main function creates a binary tree and prints out its contents one-dimensionally in 4 different orders: pre-order, in-order, post-order and level-order.  
The 4 different orders are implemented in the file and can be examined there.  

The challenges are:
1. Reconstruct an identical tree using the pre-order and in-order list.
2. Reconstruct an identical tree using the in-order and level-order list.
 
The main function prints out all lists of the tree, as well as those of the trees returned by your solutions, and indicates if the solution was successful.
